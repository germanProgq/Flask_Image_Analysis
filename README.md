# Flask Image Analyzer with Sound

This Flask-based image analyzer adds sound to an image based on sinusoidal or cosinusoidal patterns detected in the image. It provides a simple web interface for users to upload an image and receive an audio representation of the image's frequency content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/germanProgq/Flask_Image_Analysis
    cd flask-image-analysis
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
   
3. Upload an image using the provided form.

4. Click "Analyze" to process the uploaded image.

5. The analysis result will be displayed, including the uploaded image and a corresponding sound wave.

## Customization

- **Analysis Method:** You can modify the `analyze_image` function in `app.py` to customize the image analysis method.
- **User Interface:** Customize HTML templates (`templates/index.html` and `templates/result.html`) to change the user interface and design.
